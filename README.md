Hey Guys, We have learnt about the Go Back-N protocol in computer netwroks which is one of the sliding window protocol.
The total logic of how packets are transferred from sender and how acknowledgements are received from receiver are clearly written in code using JAVA graphical user interface.

Initially, a user interface is created on sender side. Some buttons are designed for sending new packets and jlabel is used for representing packets and all that stuff. 
Basic Socket programming is introduced to do changes in sender and receiver parallely to build a connection.
